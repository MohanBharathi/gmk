        Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was
        challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a
        separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947,
        Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was
        partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a
        Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs
        made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out,
        especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official
        celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas,
        attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook
        several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of
        these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the
        indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to
        Pakistan. Although the Government of India relented, as did the
        religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his
        defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged
        in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram
        Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated
        Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer
        meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is
        commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and
        worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly,
        though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in India[4][5]
        and was commonly called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa).
